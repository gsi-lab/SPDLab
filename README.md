# SPDLab
Simulation-based flowsheet synthesis workflows for wastewater treatment plant design.

SPDLab is a MATLAB-based toolbox providing classes and functions automating simulation-based process synthesis and design of wastewater treatement plants (WWTPs). It implements the framework published in the following papers.

**Towards development of a decision support tool for conceptual design of wastewater treatment plants using stochastic simulation optimization**

**Stochastic simulation-based superstructure optimization framework for process synthesis and design under uncertainty**

**A process synthesis tool for WWTP - An application to design sustainable energy resource recovery facilities**

### Installing SPDLab
Downloading and adding the folder path to your current MATLAB session will suffice to make use of the full functionality of the toolbox.
